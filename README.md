## Getting started

Pre-requisites of the project :

- ply
- pydot
- Graphviz

If you don't have these dependencies installed yet, follow the procedure below (from the root of the project):

1. `pip install pipenv`
2. `pipenv shell`
3. `pipenv install`

To install graphiz follow the installation procedure on this [link](http://www.graphviz.org/download/).

**If you are on windows don't forget to add graphiz to the PATH variable**

If you want to run C++ code generated by the transpiler, install a C++ compiler and compile.

## Transpiler from Python to C++

To run the transpiler, execute the command below from the **src/scripts** folder:

`python transpiler_py2c.py path/file_name.py`
